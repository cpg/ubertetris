ÜberTetris is a programmable video wall of giant-size RGB pixels to ... play tetris (or other games) on, via smartphones or tablets.

It is my first (personal) electronics project in nearly 20+ years, when I went rogue and defected to (mostly) software. My last project was on the early [MIT 6.270](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chuck/robotpg/robofaq/17.html#17.1) boards in the 92-97 period (these boards morphed eventually into the Lego Mindstorms).

The project started at a [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/) hardware hackathon. The motives were somewhat sinister, however ...
